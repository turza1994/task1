# Folder Structure App

This is a web application for managing a hierarchical folder structure. Users can create and delete folders within a "root" folder, but the root folder itself cannot be deleted. The app uses a Node.js backend with Express and Mongoose for the API, and a React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
